# BettingdApp
Betting dApp with 2 different Oracle implementations made for the Ethereum network.

Prerequisites
Due to the simplicity of the project we will write and deploy our smart contract onto a test net with MetaMask and Remix.
(https://metamask.io/)
(https://remix.ethereum.org).

The first thing weâ€™ll need is nodeJS and NPM, get them here and follow the installation steps for your OS: https://nodejs.org/en/.

Next, install MetaMask(see link above).

Our last prerequisite is vue-cli, this will help us easily set up a VueJS project

Open Command prompt with elevated privleges. Run 

"node -v"

"npm -v"

to check if NodeJS and NPM are installed correctly.

Next install https://git-scm.com/downloads

After that, clone the git with 

git clone https://github.com/flisko/BettingdApp

then "cd BettingdApp" and "cd betting-dapp"

After that we will install web3 and font awesome using "npm i web3@^0.20.0 vuex font-awesome -s"

To start the project use "npm start".

This installs the default project. See Readme inside betting-dapp folder for more specific information regarding the actual smart contarct code and the dApp itself.
